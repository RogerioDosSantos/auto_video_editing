# Auto video editing 

This project is inspired by the excelent article from *Dmytro Nikolaiev* *Automatic Video Editing using Python*. The goal of this project is to automatically cut some video fragments and then join these fragments together, as well to provide additional commands that allows you to merge different videos. 

It has to receive data about these fragments in two ways:

- Automated (partially automatic, with some human intervention) — recognizing control words, and
- Automatic (completely automatic, without human intervention) — identifying long moments of silence
